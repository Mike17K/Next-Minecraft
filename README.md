# Next-Minecraft

This is a minecraft clone made in the time of one semester, using opengl i created a functional minecraft game 
with basic features like 
- braking 
- placing blocks 
- gravity
- colisions
- water waves simulation

# To run 
Install vsc and cmake the project, or just cmake it
u need to have a gpu, and run the executable after building it

have fun!
